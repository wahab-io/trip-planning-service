    "lodging": "Based on your budget and preferences, I recommend staying in the Marais district. Consider Hotel des Grands Boulevards ($180/night) for boutique charm, or Airbnb apartments near Place des Vosges ($120/night) for authentic Parisian living. Both offer excellent access to attractions and dining.",
    "food": "For dining, explore local bistros like L'As du Fallafel in the Marais for budget-friendly meals ($15-20). For special occasions, book Le Comptoir du Relais ($45-60 per person). Don't miss morning croissants from Du Pain et des Id√©es and evening wine at natural wine bars in the 11th arrondissement.",
    "travel": "Book flights 6-8 weeks in advance for best prices ($600-800 from major US cities). Purchase a weekly Metro pass ($30) for unlimited public transport. Consider day trips to Versailles ($20 train ticket) and allocate 2-3 days for major attractions like the Louvre and Eiffel Tower."
